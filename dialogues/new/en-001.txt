"Yes? What is it?"
-"I came to buy skins for John the trader."
	"And how do I know that he sent you?"
	-"I have a letter from him"
		"Show me that paper. Okay, that seems fine. Here's a shipment of skins. Just take it to John right away."
	-"So, how can I convince you?"
		"Bring me some evidence from him."
-"Who are you?"
	"I am a hunter."
	-"What's your name?"
		"It's not important. Address me directly."
	-"All right."
-"What are you doing here?"
	"I usually hunt, but right now I'm resting."
	-"What are you hunting?"
		"Mostly wolves and platypuses."
	-"All right."
-"Goodbye."
